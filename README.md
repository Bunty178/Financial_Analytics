## Financial_Analytics
#### In this project, I utilized Pandas DataFrame to represent adjusted closing prices and calculate moving averages, daily returns, and associated risk for 'FAANG' tech companies. I created visual representations of comparative daily returns and single-stock analysis using Matplotlib, and developed more complex heatmaps and distribution plots with Seaborn. Additionally, I compared and plotted investment risk using both simple return analysis techniques and Monte Carlo simulations.
